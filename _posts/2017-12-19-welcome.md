It is hard to predict how exactly AI will transform our society, but many experts agree that it will. This transformation will impact all of us, and we should be ready for it. The goal of this course is to democratize the knowledge of AI; going byond mathematitions and engineers. 

We are offering the course for free but we expect the sudents to apply for the course. The application might take up to 30 mins, and our goal is to select students who are commited to learning. As the first class, we plan to take 25 students and hold the class in the eBay office auditorium. 

And finally, we need help in the class, and please volunteer to help when you apply for the course.
