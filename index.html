Welcome to AI for Everyone course
</H1>

In this course we'll be teaching AI and Machine Learning to non-Engineers. You are not expected
to be an expert in Probability, Statistics, Computer Vision, Linear Algebra or Programming 
though familiarity with those concepts will make the class more interesting. 

<br/>
We are two passionate AI experts who have been building exciting products both at Startups and at
large companies. 

<br/>
This is going to be an exciting 12-week journey! Welcome aboard. Please fill out this survey and we'll 
get back to you will logistics, details and such. For this initial class, we are limiting participation
to 30 students. So, if you didn't get in, don't worry. We'll be offering another session shortly.
